(c) 2006 Qwaq Inc. TSimpleSlideShow is an example showing how to do a NON-replicated embedded app. TSimpleSlideShow will display pictures from the contents of a local folder which can (and typically will) be different from user to user. It also filters events based on the user ID meaning that if you click on the slide show only your local view will change. Remember, this is an example, it may not be useful to you.

Instance variables:
	imageFolder		<FileDirectory>	The directory to use
	imageName		<String>			The name of the currently displayed image.
