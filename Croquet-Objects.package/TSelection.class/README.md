target - this is the frame object owner
frame - this is the frame object that is selected.
framePosition - this is the ray location relative to the selected object.
parent - this is the parent of the selectedFrame at the time of rendering/selection.
parentCameraTransform - this is the transform of the camera frame at selection time
distance - this is the distance from the ray position.
distanceSquared - this is the squared distance from the ray position.
index - this may be used by the selectedObject. It is usually the surface index.
normal - this is the surface normal at the selectedPoint.
point - this is the selected point in the local selectedFrame reference.
triangle - used by TSelectionTracker
cameraTransform - the camera global transform at the last time of selection.
scale - the current scale at which we picked this object. Used by TPortal3D.
