TAvatarUser

I am the user side of the TUser/TAvatar pair. I handle all of the direct control messages generated by the user and interpret them and forward them to the actual TAvatar. I also check for portal collisions so that I can manage the TAvatar transition from space to space. Finally, I manage how the camera is positioned relative to the TAvatar.
